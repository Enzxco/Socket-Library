Guessing Game Server by Lawrence Robles Secjadas

This is a simple server implementation of a guessing game. The server allows clients to connect, input their name, choose a difficulty level, and then play the guessing game. After each game, the server saves the user's name and score to a leaderboard file specific to the difficulty level.

How To Run?
1. Get the code into your computers, make sure to seperate the client.py and server.py
2. Run the server.py first, then the client.py after.
3. Start Guessing the numbers.
4. Enjoy!
